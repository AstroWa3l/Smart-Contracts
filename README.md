# Smart-Contracts

##### I will be uploading various smart contracts to be used in future DApp projects..

##### In order to run the various haskell smart contracts written in Marlowe you must go to IOHK's Marlowe playground here: https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/ Once you have arrived at the main page choose "New Project", then choose the "Marlowe" editor, then you can clear the contents in the Marlowe editor and paste in the smart contracts here and start the simulation to see if it all worked :)
